5G is expected to satisfy the requirements of a low latency, low cost and support of diverse compelling devices. Over the past few decades, wireless communication systems have witnessed a “revolution” in terms of their multiple access techniques. For the conventional wireless communication techniques systems frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA). From the perspective of their design principles, these multiple access schemes belong to the category of orthogonal multiple access (OMA).
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an innovative concept in 5G, which can support more users than the number of available orthogonal TDMA, FDMA or code-domain resources. 

The basic idea of NOMA is to support non-orthogonal orthogonal resource allocation among the users at the ultimate cost of increase receive complexity, which is required for separating the non-orthogonal signals. 

Recently several NOMA solutions have been actively investigated, which can be basically divided into two main categories, namely power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA.

## Advantages of NOMA Compared to OMA

- Improved spectral efficiency and cell -edge throughput
- Massive connectivity
- Low transmission latency and signaling cost
- Relaxed channel feedback

## Power-domain NOMA

At the transmitter, different signals generated by different users are directly superimposed on each other after classic channel coding and modulation. Multiple users share the same time-frequency resources, and then are detected at the receivers by MUD algorithms such as SIC. In this way, the spectral efficienc can be enhanced at the cost of an increased receiver complexity compared to conventional OMA.

### Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)

SIC is a decoding method in power-domain NOMA, which the user with strong channel conditions are capable of removing the interference of weak users. 



Without loss of generality, assume that the users are ordered based on their channel quality, i.e.,

$|h_1|^2 \le ... \le |h_k|^2$

The use of NOMA implies $|p_1| \ge ... \ge |p_k|$, with $\sum_{m=1}^K p_{m} = 1$. Conventional detection will be carried out at the K-th user at the end of the phase. 

- Downlink NOMA: The strong interfering signals are mainly due to the high power message signals og relatively weak channel users. As such, to extract the desired signal, each user cancels the strong interferences by successively decoding, remodulating, and subtracting them
from the received signal x. Subsequently, the highest channel gain user cancels all intra-cluster interferences, whereas the lowest channel gain user receives the interferences from all users within its cluster.

- Uplink NOMA: Different from the downlink NOMA, the signal is decoded first at the BS and experiences interference from all users in the cluster with relatively weaker channels. That is, the transmission of the highest channel gain user experiences interference from all users within its cluster, whereas the transmission of the lowest channel gain user receives zero interference from the users in its cluster.

### Direct Transmission Phase

Consider a broadcast channel with one base station and $K$ user.

The base station sends $K$ messages to the destinations based on the NOMA principle i.e., the base station sends $\sum_{m=1}^{K} \sqrt{p_m} s_m$, where the $s_m$ is the message for the m-th user, and $p_m$ is the power allocation coefficient for the user. 

The observation at the k-th user is given by 

$y_{1,k} = \sum_{m=1}^{K}h_k \sqrt{p_m} s_m + n_k$,

where $h_k$ denotes the Rayleigh fading channel coefficient from the base station to the k-th user and $n_k$ denotes the additive Gaussian noise. 



The received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for the base station k and n-th device can be expressed as follows:

$SINR_{k,n} = \frac{h_{k,n}^2,p_{k,n}}{\sum_{m=1,m!=n}^{K}h_{k,m}^2 p_{k,m} + \delta^2}$.

With the use of SIC, the SINR between base station k and device n can be expressed as follow:

$SINR_{k,n} = \frac{h_{k,n}^2,p_{k,n}}{\sum_{m=n+1}^{K}h_{k,m}^2 p_{k,m} + \delta^2}$.

### Transmission Rate

The transmission rate between base station k and n-th user can be calculated as

$R_{k,n} = \log_{2}(1 + SINR_{k,n})$.

### Cooperative Transmission Phase

#### Cooperative SINR

The SINR between base station k and n-th user, can be calculated as

$SINR_{k,n} = \frac{h_{k,n}^2,p_{k,n}}{\sum_{m=n+1}^{k}h_{k,m}^2 p_{k,m} + \delta^2} + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{h_{k,i-1}^2 p_{k,i-1}}{\sum_{m=i}^{k-1}h_{k,m}^2 p_{k,m} + \delta^2}$.

Comparing the direct transmission SINR to the cooperation transmission SINR, we can see that the use of cooperation can boost reception reliability.

## More specific

When we are considering a wireless communication scenery, there are some coefficient that may affect the transmission rate.

### Channel Gain
Channel gain is the coefficient that imply the quality of the channel. In a wireless communication channel, the transmitted signal can travel from transmitter to receiver over multiple reflective paths. This gives rise to multipath fading which causes fluctuations in amplitude, phase and angle of arrival of the received signal. For example, the transmitted signal from the base station may suffer multiple reflections from the buildings nearby, before reaching the base station.

#### Rayleigh Fading 
Rayleigh fading is viewed as a reasonable model for tropospheric and ionospheric signal propagation as well as the effect of heavily built-up urban environments on radio signals. Rayleigh fading is most applicable when there is no dominant propagation along a line of sight between the transmitter and receiver.

#### Rician Fading
Rician fading is stochastic model for radio propagation in which there is Line of Sight(LoS) component present in the signal.

### Path Loss
The large-scale path loss can be computed in different ways due to different sceneries. There is a popular way to compute it as

$L(d) = d^{-\alpha}$,

where $\alpha$ is the pass loss factor adjusted according to different sceneries.

### Thermal Noise Power
-174dBm/Hz is the absolute value of thermal noise power of resistance at room temperature (20℃). The background noise power $P{dBm}$ for bandwide $B$ can be computed as
$P_{dBm} = -174 + 10 \log_{10}(B)$.

### Spectral efficiency
Spectral efficiency refers to the information rate that can be transmitted over a given bandwidth in a specific communication system. It is a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized by the physical layer protocol, and sometimes by the media access control (the channel access protocol).

The spectral efficiency for 4G cellular is 5 bits/s/Hz. whereas the spectral efficiency of 5G cellular is 5~15 times as much as 4G theoretically.
